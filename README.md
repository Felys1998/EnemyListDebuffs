# EnemyListDebuffs
This plugin provides a graphical debuff icon with countdown timer on your enmity list, making it easier to track your debuffs and DoTs in multi-target scenarios.

## Adoption
As of 7.3 I no longer play the game actively and I am putting up the plugin for adoption for anyone who'd like to take up the reins on it. You will need to be comfortable with baseline IDA or Ghidra usage and C#.

Please reach out to me on GitHub if you'd like to adopt.
